 <h1>Cars by Country Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h3>Group Members: Savanna Sito, Wyatt Van Dyke, Paige Wade</h3>
 <p>For the final project, our group discovered a link under project 2 classic dataset examples which contained the cars.csv dataset we used. <br />
 After deciding on this dataset, we sent several messages back and forth brainstorming our ideas for what to visualize. We thought about <br />
 what country makes the best cars and which car is fastest or the most fuel-efficient. We settled on comparing cars by country to see what <br />
 country had the fastest or most fuel-efficient cars.</p>
 <p>Once we settled on what to visualize we had to determine how to visualize it. Again, we bounced ideas back and forth in a brainstorming <br />
 session and came up with a wide variety of ideas for visualizations and interactions. Our first idea was a verticle bargraph with categories <br />
 on the x-axis and whatever attribute we wanted to measure on the y-axis which would split the bars into individual items when viewing within a <br />
 category. The next idea mentioned was a map with colors representing speed and efficiency that when you hover over a particular country, a table <br />
 pops up showing cars from that country and their data. We started to persue this idea and quickly discovered that only three countries were represented <br />
 in the dataset so there was likely a better way to express this data. We came back to the bar chart directon with an idea of either a stacked bar chart <br />
 measuring speed and efficiency for each country or one with one bar per country where you can change what it is showing. This idea was the closest we <br />
 had so far so we decided to visualize it on paper as shown below.</p>

 <p>The idea of changing what the bars were displaying lead us to the idea of a scatter plot with the year of the car on the x-axis and interactive variables <br />
 on the y-axis. We also came up with color coding the points for the three different countries.</p>
