 <h1>Cars by Country Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h3>Group Members: Savanna Sito, Wyatt Van Dyke, Paige Wade</h3>
 <p>For the final project, our group discovered a link under project 2 classic dataset examples which contained the cars.csv dataset we used. <br />
  After deciding on this dataset, we sent several messages back and forth brainstorming our ideas for what to visualize. We thought about <br />
  what country makes the best cars and which car is fastest or the most fuel efficient. We settled on comparing cars by country to see what country had the fastest or most fuel efficient cars.</p>
