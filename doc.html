 <h1>Cars by Country Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h3>Group Members: Savanna Sito, Wyatt Van Dyke, Paige Wade</h3>
 <p>For the final project, our group discovered a link under project 2 classic dataset examples which contained the cars.csv dataset we used. <br />
  After deciding on this dataset, we sent several messages back and forth brainstorming our ideas for what to visualize. We thought about <br />
  what country makes the best cars and which car is fastest or the most fuel efficient. We settled on comparing cars by country to see what <br />
  country had the fastest or most fuel efficient cars.</p>
 <p>Once we settled on what to visualize we had to determine how to visualize it. Again, we bounced ideas back and forth in a brainstorming <br />
 session and came up with a wide variety of ideas for visualizations and interactions. Our first idea was an verticle bargraph with categories on the x-axis.</p>
