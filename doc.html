 <h1>Cars by Country Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h3>Group Members: Savanna Sito, Wyatt Van Dyke, Paige Wade</h3>
 <p>For the final project, our group discovered a link under project 2 classic dataset examples which contained the cars.csv dataset we used. <br />
 After deciding on this dataset, we sent several messages back and forth brainstorming our ideas for what to visualize. We thought about <br />
 what country makes the best cars and which car is fastest or the most fuel-efficient. We settled on comparing cars by country to see what <br />
 country had the fastest or most fuel-efficient cars.</p>
 <p>Once we settled on what to visualize we had to determine how to visualize it. Again, we bounced ideas back and forth in a brainstorming <br />
 session and came up with a wide variety of ideas for visualizations and interactions. Our first idea was a vertical bar graph with categories <br />
 on the x-axis and whatever attribute we wanted to measure on the y-axis which would split the bars into individual items when viewing within a <br />
 category. The next idea mentioned was a map with colors representing speed and efficiency that when you hover over a particular country, a table <br />
 pops up showing cars from that country and their data. We started to pursue this idea and quickly discovered that only three countries were represented <br />
 in the dataset so there was likely a better way to express this data. We came back to the bar chart direction with an idea of either a stacked bar chart <br />
 measuring speed and efficiency for each country or one with one bar per country where you can change what it is showing. This idea was the closest we <br />
 had so far so we decided to visualize it on paper as shown below.</p>

 <p>The idea of changing what the bars were displaying lead us to the idea of a scatter plot with the year of the car on the x-axis and interactive variables <br />
 on the y-axis. We also came up with color-coding the points for the three different countries. This idea became our interactive visualization:</p>
 <img src="https://toyhammer98.github.io/visinfo-cars-project/FinalVisualizationEx.PNG" alt="Final Design Idea" width="500" height="400">
 <p>The variables in our dataset include the name of the car, miles per gallon (MPG), Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Acceleration, Model (year), <br />
 and Origin (Country). Most of these are quantitative variables that can be used in calculations. Model year doesn't fit in the same group with the other <br />
 quantitative variables which is how we knew it belonged on the x-axis as a static variable. Country and car name were the only qualitative variables so <br />
 it became clear that car names should be represented as individual points on the scatter plot and color would best represent the country of origin. <br />
 We discovered that trying to answer questions such as what car is the fastest or most efficient is actually extremely complex and involves factors <br />
 that are not included in the dataset such as wind speed, fuel type, type of tires, air intake, the list goes on and on. Because there is no possible <br />
 way to answer those questions with the dataset we decided the best course of action to take would be to allow the viewer to make their own conclusions <br />
 about the data by providing a drop-down list of the quantitative variables which controls what variable displays on the y-axis. This allows the viewer <br />
 to answer several questions at once per dynamic variable including what car is highest and lowest for that variable, what country seems to focus on that <br />
 variable, and how has that variable changed over time.</p>
 <img src="https://toyhammer98.github.io/visinfo-cars-project/dropdown.png" alt="y axis" width="500" height="400"> 
 <p>There are just over 400 cars listed in the dataset so in order for viewers to be able to see exactly what car is relative to what point, we added a hover <br />
 interaction that displays the car name relative to its point on the scatterplot. The color combination for the countries variable was very intentional because <br />
 we wanted even a color-blind person to be able to interpret the graph. We made the US blue so it would be the most visible and distinguishable because we assume <br />
 most viewers would be from the US and would want to know how the US compares to Europe and Japan, its top competitors. We struggled a bit to pick the other <br />
 two colors trying hard to work around color-blind issues. We came to an agreement on using hue and luminance variation with the dark and light green next to <br />
 the blue. It is distinguishable enough that even someone who can't perceive the color green can understand and see the points separately.</p>
 <p>Getting the maximum and minimum to change with the switching of y-axis variables took some work but was a crucial point in our visualization. We realized <br />
 that if our visualization relied on people making their own conclusions about the data, someone that had very little understanding of cars and how they work <br />
 should even be able to understand what these graphs represent. We left the y-axis title the same as how the dataset has it but made the dropdown list titles <br />
 more descriptive. For example, acceleration is the variable name in the dataset and is what displays as the y-axis title. The dropdown though shows it as <br />
 Seconds to Reach 60 MPH.</p>

 <p>Our group started this visualization by asking the question of which car is the fastest. We learned halfway through that speed is determined by many factors <br/>
 some not mentioned in our dataset. However, we did have a variable in our dataset that closely resembled speed and that was acceleration. As shown above, we <br />
 described acceleration as seconds to reach 60MPH which can be looked at as how fast the car can get to 60MPH. We selected the acceleration variable as our <br />
 y-axis and actually found two notable outliers </p>

 <p>Logic says that the heavier a car is, the more energy it will need to get it moving so it can be assumed that reducing the weight will improve a vehicle's <br />
 fuel-efficency. Along with wondering what car is the fastest we sought to determine which car is the least efficient/ the heaviest. We can't make an accurate <br />
 assumption of this question without the other factors involved in testing efficiency that are not included in our dataset. However, weight is a major determinate <br />
 and will be enough to help us answer the question.</p>
 <img src="https://toyhammer98.github.io/visinfo-cars-project/efficiency.png" alt="weight" width="500" height="400">
 <p>The Pontiac Safari is a clear winner of heaviest and therefore least efficient vehicle weighing in at over 5,000 ibs. We chose to look at the heaviest cars <br />
 even though we were measuring efficiency through weight because the visualization presented such a clear winner while trying to evaluate the lighter cars would <br />
 be much harder because there are so many points on top of each other. Several other questions can be answered using weight such as what country makes the heaviest <br />
 cars which actually is represented very clearly you can see it is definately the US, has the average vehicle weight gone up or down over time again shown clearly <br />
 it has gone down, and how much does a specific car weigh. While answering the two questions regarding fastest and least efficient, we found a correlation between <br />
 weight and acceleration so clear that it looks like the two graphs are mirroring eachother over the x axis. The points that are higest on the weight graph are the <br />
 lowest points on the acceleration graph. For the same reason, the points high on the acceleration graph are consistsntly at least below the middle of the weight graph.</p>

 <p>We wanted to know which country generally was making the "best" cars. To be the "best", a country would have to match each variable in terms of if having a high number <br />
 is a good thing for that particular variable. To form an opinion with the visualizaations, our group first went through each y-axis variable and determined if each country <br />
 was high medium or low for what that variable required to be considered good. In each variable's case except for weight, a high number meant the car was better. Here is <br />
 an example of how we determined if a country was high, medium, or low.</p>
 <img src="https://toyhammer98.github.io/visinfo-cars-project/RatingEx.png" alt="weight" width="500" height="400">
 <p>MPG is easy to determine if a country is high or low because as it is easy to see, the points group in such a way that they stack on top of each other like stairs. In <br />
 the case of MPG, Japan is high, Europe is medium, and the US is low. We did this for each variable until we came up with this table:</p>
 <img src="https://toyhammer98.github.io/visinfo-cars-project/CarsbyCountryTable.jpg" alt="weight" width="800" height="300">
 <p>The black checkmarks signify the "winner" of that variable so as you can see, the US is superior at making cars in almost every way. This also showed us the fact that <br />
 they value speed over MPG.</p>
 <p>Overall as a group, we feel that we chose an excellent dataset for this project and that we were able to make very meaningful observations from it. We are proud of how <br />
 interactive it is, our design choices, and the questions we were able to answer with the data. We worked really well as a group and were all able to contribute something <br />
 meaningful and useful to the visualization. We all feel that we learned a lot from this project and we enjoyed creating it.</p>
