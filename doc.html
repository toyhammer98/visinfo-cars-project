 <h1>Cars by Country Final Project Documentation</h1>
<h3>Group Members: Savanna Sito, Wyatt Van Dyke, Paige Wade</h3>
 <p>For the final project, our group discovered a link under project 2 classic dataset examples which contained the cars.csv dataset we used. <br />
 After deciding on this dataset, we sent several messages back and forth brainstorming our ideas for what to visualize. We thought about <br />
 what country makes the best cars and which car is fastest or the most fuel-efficient. We settled on comparing cars by country to see what <br />
 country had the fastest or most fuel-efficient cars.</p>
 <p>Once we settled on what to visualize we had to determine how to visualize it. Again, we bounced ideas back and forth in a brainstorming <br />
 session and came up with a wide variety of ideas for visualizations and interactions. Our first idea was a verticle bargraph with categories <br />
 on the x-axis and whatever attribute we wanted to measure on the y-axis which would split the bars into individual items when viewing within a <br />
 category. The next idea mentioned was a map with colors representing speed and efficiency that when you hover over a particular country, a table <br />
 pops up showing cars from that country and their data. We started to persue this idea and quickly discovered that only three countries were represented <br />
 in the dataset so there was likely a better way to express this data. We came back to the bar chart directon with an idea of either a stacked bar chart <br />
 measuring speed and efficiency for each country or one with one bar per country where you can change what it is showing. This idea was the closest we <br />
 had so far so we decided to visualize it on paper as shown below.</p>

 <p>The idea of changing what the bars were displaying lead us to the idea of a scatter plot with the year of the car on the x-axis and interactive variables <br />
 on the y-axis. We also came up with color coding the points for the three different countries. This idea became our interactive visualization:</p>

 <p>The variables in our dataset include name of the car, miles per gallon (MPG), Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Acceleration, Model (year), and <br />
 Origin (Country). Most of these are quantitative variables that can be used in calculations. Model year doesn't fit in the same group with the other <br />
 quantitative variables which is how we knew it belogned on the x-axis as a static variable. Country, and car name were the only qualitative variables so <br />
 it became clear that car name should be represented as individual points on the scatter plot and color would best represent the country of origin. <br />
 We discovered that Trying to answer questions such as what car is the fastest or most efficient is actually extremely complex and invloves factors <br />
 that are not included in the dataset such as wind speed, fuel type, type of tires, air intake, the list goes on and on. Because there is no possible <br />
 way to answer those questions with the dataset we decided the best course of action to take would be to allow the viewer to make their own conclusions <br />
 about the data by providing a drop down list of the qantitative variables which controls what variable displays on the y-axis. This allows the viewer <br />
 to answer several questions at once per dynamic variable including what car is highest and lowest for that variable, what country seems to focus on that <br />
 variable, and how has that variable changed over time.</p>

 <p>There are just over 400 cars listed in the dataset so in order for viewers to be able to see exactly what car is relative to what point, we added a hover <br />
 interaction that displays the car name relative to its point on the scatterplot.</p>
